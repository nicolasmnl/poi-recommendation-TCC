# Points of Interest Recommendation System Using Geographic Embeddings

This repository contains the source code used in research that proposes and evaluates the use of geographic embeddings to improve Points of Interest (POIs) recommendation systems.

## Context

POI recommendation has gained prominence in the context of recommendation systems, especially with the growth of Location-Based Social Networks, such as Foursquare, Gowalla and Yelp. The quality of these recommendations is essential to enrich the user experience on these platforms, facilitating sociability and promoting tourism.

## Problem

Traditional POI recommendation systems are often limited to considering information such as location reviews, photos, access times and check-ins, neglecting relevant geographic data such as geographic features that include rivers, buildings, streets and lakes in the context of a POI. . These features can significantly influence user preferences.

## Proposed solution

In this study, we propose and evaluate the use of geographic embeddings that incorporate geographic features to improve POI recommendation systems.

## Results

The results indicated that the use of embeddings that consider features increased accuracy and MRR by up to 1.65% in the task of recommending the next POI in the dataset used, compared to the baseline, confirming the importance of geographic features to improve geographic features. POI recommendation.
